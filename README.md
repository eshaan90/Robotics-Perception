 Projects on Projective Geometry and Stereo Correspondence

1) Dolly zoom effect using projective transformation
2) Image projection onto a video using Homographies and Inverse Warping
3) Simple Augmented Reality application using Pose Estimation and KLT Tracker (To be added)
4) Structure from motion-Computing camera poses and 3D point cloud (To be added) 


All projects implemented in MATLAB and are self-contained.
